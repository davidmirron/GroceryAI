# Recipe Feature Improvements Plan

## Issues Identified

1. **"My Recipes" Section Confusion**: The "My Recipes" section sometimes shows a mix of custom recipes and default recipes due to the fallback logic.

2. **"Save Recipe" Functionality**: Though the Save Recipe functionality works (saving to Core Data), saved recipes aren't clearly displayed in a dedicated location.

3. **"See All" Button Ineffective**: The See All button in the My Recipes section only highlights the current section rather than navigating to a full view.

## Improvements Implemented

1. **Fixed Recipe Classification Logic**: 
   - Improved the `customRecipes()` function to more reliably identify truly custom recipes
   - Removed the fallback logic that incorrectly included default recipes
   - Prioritized the RecipeListViewModel's recipes as the source of truth for user's saved recipes

2. **Enhanced "Save Recipe" Function**:
   - Updated the `addToRecipeList()` method to properly mark saved recipes as custom
   - Added a refresh trigger to ensure saved recipes appear immediately in the My Recipes section
   - Ensured all recipe metadata is preserved when saving

3. **Implemented "See All" Navigation**:
   - Added a dedicated sheet view that displays all saved custom recipes
   - Included empty state handling for when no recipes have been saved
   - Added ability to create new recipes directly from this view

## Future Improvements

1. **Recipe Collections**:
   - Implement the ability to organize saved recipes into custom collections (e.g., "Favorites", "Quick Meals", etc.)
   - Allow reordering of recipes within collections

2. **Improved Recipe Filtering**:
   - Add more sophisticated filtering options for saved recipes (by cuisine, ingredient, cooking time, etc.)
   - Add sorting options (alphabetical, most recent, most used)

3. **Cross-Device Sync**:
   - Implement CloudKit integration to sync saved recipes across user's devices

4. **Recipe Sharing**:
   - Allow users to share recipes with friends via standard iOS share sheet
   - Consider integration with social media platforms

5. **Recipe Import**:
   - Add ability to import recipes from popular recipe websites or via URL

6. **Analytics**:
   - Track which recipes are most frequently viewed or cooked
   - Use this data to improve recipe recommendations

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Recipe Data Model Consistency**:
   - Standardize how custom recipes are identified (rely solely on the `isCustomRecipe` flag)
   - Clean up redundant recipe storage logic
   
2. **Core Data Optimization**:
   - Review Core Data fetch requests to ensure they're optimized
   - Add proper error handling for all Core Data operations

3. **UI Performance**:
   - Use LazyVStacks and pagination for smoother scrolling in recipe lists
   - Optimize image loading and caching for recipe thumbnails
